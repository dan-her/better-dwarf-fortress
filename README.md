# better-dwarf-fortress
A terrarium of dwarves living their lives: eating apples, smashing rocks, being killed by demons.

Each rock smashed gives you money that you can spend to buy apples, dwarves, or pieces of the fabled Dragon's egg.

When a dwarf eats an apple, they are duplicated.

KEY:

a - apple

d - dwarf

H - demon

\# - rock
